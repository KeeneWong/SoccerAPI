<!-- This section should walk a reader, step by step, through the process of setting up your project
For a tool meant to be integrated into other projects, this would likely outline the process of installing and accessing this tool in your project
For an application, this would likely outline the process of forking, cloning, and starting the app locally -->

If you are interested of helping me to developing this game more further :).
You can fork it in git hub.
1. Go to my github  repo and fork it by click the clone button atr the top right corner.
2. clone it by copy the link and run the comment "git clone "the link" "
3. Open it locally at your computer and play around !!
